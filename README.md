Minimal-ish NIF in Rust
===============================================================================

All other examples that I found used older versions and did not work with the
recent-ish releases:

- Erlang/OTP: `25.3.2.13`
- rebar: `3.23.0+build.5411.reffbb8263d`
- Rust: `1.77.0`
- rustler: `0.34`

Most helpful example was <https://github.com/filmor/faster_xml/>, which I
stripped and tweaked.
